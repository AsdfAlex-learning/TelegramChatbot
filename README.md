# TelegramChatbot

This is the entry-point README of the repository. For more detailed explanations and documentation (in Chinese), please refer to:

- Chinese Development Guide (DEVELOPMENT): [Click Here](docs\zh-CN\DEVELOPMENT.md)

Since the project is still under development, other documents such as INSTALL.md are basically not maintained. Documents in other languages are also not available for the time being. The only Chinese documentation is also written in a casual, idea-driven manner without systematic organization.

## Project Introduction

This repository implements a chatbot based on the official Telegram Bot Framework and Nonebot. It enables AI conversations with users by calling the DeepSeek API, and supports features like custom PROMPTs, API key configuration, fragmented responses, and conversation memory (short-term/long-term). The project is currently in active development. For detailed implementation, configuration and usage instructions, please read the Chinese documentation linked above.

Rather than a fully-featured, polished chatbot, this project is more like the very first side project of an average (or even arguably unskilled) computer science student starting from scratch. It contains a lot of personal, subjective elements, so the code and documentation may not be concise or accurate enough.
